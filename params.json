CanVec and CanVec+ datasets, which include all data used\r\nto create Canadian topographic maps, are two such datasets that are useful\r\nin creating vector-based maps for locations across Canada. This packages searches\r\nCanVec data by location, plots it using pretty defaults, and exports it to\r\nhuman-readable shapefiles for use in another GIS.\r\n\r\nThe gist of it:\r\n```R\r\nlibrary(rcanvec)\r\nlibrary(prettymapr)\r\n\r\ncanvec.qplot(bbox=searchbbox(\"wolfville ns\"))\r\n\r\n#or use {prettymapr} to make it look nice\r\nprettymap(canvec.qplot(bbox=searchbbox(\"wolfville ns\"))\r\n```\r\n![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10995762/10892282/e17317c6-8178-11e5-8c9d-b7136796bb66.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the [PDF Manual](https://github.com/paleolimbot/rcanvec/files/15517/rcanvec_0.1.3-manual.pdf) for more details, or see the [tutorial](tutorial/rcanvec_tutorial.md).\r\n","google":"UA-73397650-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
